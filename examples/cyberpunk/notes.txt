# CTF Ideas

To Do
* made code harder to reverse
    * add dummy success functions -> eg. if you are only partially successful, you get a wrong password.
    * spread the check around in multiple places.
    * dummy function -> feed him bad code?
    * You can make the puzzle harder by using a jump table instead of a comparison+conditional jump.
    * write own custom read joypad function
* make a blog post on my website to host this puzzle
* submit the puzzle

Once i get the art
* write out the dialog for both scenes
* draw walking animation

Nice to have
* change all constants to be defined with 0xFFU
* Level 2 logic!
* UNIT TESTS
* remove nintendo from the beginning of the game... .-.
* Sounds....
* make gbdk more efficient
* make all assets the same line width in the code

Done
* figure out the password
* have a way to store button presses
* read in the buttons
* check for the right sequence
* debounce the buttons, potentially? is it needed? YES
* decide on the flag
* update the font data - now with a comma!
* have a way to show the answer was wrong.
* show the winning screen
* encode the final flag - so you can't  find the pw with strings
* scatter the key around the ROM
* collect the keys while executing the program
* when the good password is entered, decrypt the pw
* load memory map of that password
* yayyy should still see password -> but no strings of pw in ROM
* find a way to display which key is pressed
* fix the button display indexing
* the last button input arrow is being displayed in the wrong place??
* debounce keys better
* need to be able to input more than once button at once
* FIXME: in the intro text after the ellipses, the arrow cursor is too far.
* show sequence of what you've already pressed on screen
* edit ellipses character to be at the bottom of the tile, not middle.
* load in the background
* fix (unsigned blah) to const UINT8.
* make sure button presses are ok...
* blinking in animation for agent
* fix window to load border from the black space I have already -> why are bg and window loaded from separate space from sprites?
* fix the win screen
* write out the hints
* write out the recommended tools.
* Change all UBYTE and UWORD to UINT8 etc
* if enter konami code, it will say "long live kojima"

Won't Do
* randomize how the tiles are loaded in vram
* make a new text system so im not translating ascii to character map in the game
* figure out best way to load dialog into game (probably hard coded character maps)
* port from GBDK to a custom GB library...
* make the encryption optimized for the GBA

Players have to find the solution sequence to open the door.
I don't want players to just jump to the final pass function or find the
solution in ROM, so I'm encrypting the flag and scattering the key
around the ROM so force the player to execute all of the ROM. LOL Jor called that white box crypto.

Password:
    S N N S E N S W N W W N S N E N

    S W A N B A N S S A N E W E B S
    D L A U B A U D     D A U R L R B D
    16 button presses

Flag:
    girl power? some feminist message?
    something about hacking?

## Story

She is a hired pen tester. Hacking her way through this VR world.
She is tracking down a rogue AI who is corrupting the VR world.
Level 1. street, match the password
Level 2. computer, fake the network packets to the GB
Level 3. edit the rom in some way lmao

How to use the GBMD

The tile offset is in decimal. It wants the offset of where in the bank your tiles start. Need to set 8 bits per plane.

Boss: Our alt
reality world
is at risk.

Your mission is
to track down
the rogue AI.

Are you ready?

Agent: You got
it boss.
I'm going in.

L O A D I N G
A G E N T ...

<flash animation>

My target is
inside.
This door needs
a code...


After success:
show full screen of text to tell some story!




Failure:
    I can not die here.
    I still have so many
    regrets in life.
    If only I had more power... (AHEM CLUE)

Success:

    <discuss morality of something>

    Why are you after me?
    I did nothing wrong!

    Your existence is wrong.

    pew pew (zap?)

    The rogue AI has been terminated.
    My mission is complete.

    (she walks away as sun is rising on the city)

    She blinks out of existence when she reaches the exit portal.

## Hints

SMALLHINT.txt

You're walking through the street after a long day of chasing your target—but with nothing in hand to show for your work. You stumble through the busy streets of Chinatown, lit by neon lights and filled with the lazy chatter of the crowd.

The person ahead of you seems to be walking home with a steaming bag of Chinese takeout. A fortune cookie tumbles out of her bag. You reach down to return the cookie to its owner, but when you look up, your hungry target has disappeared into the crowd—probably rushing off to enjoy the dinner she had in hand.

"Another target escaped... maybe I really am losing my touch," you scour at your own perceived incompetence.

You were taught to never waste any food, so you crack open the cookie and inside you find your fortune:

07BC are you lucky numbers.  // insert address to where NO GOOD is loaded.



BIGHINT.txt

You find yourself in a dark and quiet bar—you're not even sure how long you've been here. The digital alcohol distorts your perception of time like no other beverage you've experienced. Suspicion crosses your mind as you wonder how you could be getting drunk in a digital simulation, but another more pressing thought pushes its way through.

This puzzle is still unsolved. Will all your troubles so far go to waste? You are left with no other choice than what you're about to do. You pull up your user space terminal—a holographic blue screen lights up the otherwise colorless bar. You slowly type in the command to start a call with the external world.

"Boss speaking."

You are simultaneously relieved and dreading to hear that voice.

"Boss, I need help. I think this world is rigged—could this all just be a game someone is playing?"

"No time to break the fourth wall Agent, I just received insider information from an anonymous informant. She didn't leave her name, but she did leave us some crucial information about your target. You're looking for a 16 digit code to open the door. She left me with the address 0x______." // insert address of the 16 digit code.

"More magic numbers! The last one barely did me any good."

"It should be enough to see you through. I believe in you, Agent, and I know you won't disappoint."

And with that, the line goes silent.
