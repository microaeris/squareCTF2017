# CTF Ideas

To Do
* debounce keys better

Once i get the art
* load in the background
* write out the dialog
* figure out best way to load dialog into game (probably hard coded character maps)
* fix the win screen

Nice to have
* fix (unsigned blah) to const UINT8.
* Change all UBYTE and UWORD to UINT8 etc
* change all consts to be defined with 0xFFU
* show sequence of what you've already pressed on screen
* Level 2 logic!
* make the encryption optimized for the GBA

Done
* figure out the password
* have a way to store button presses
* read in the buttons
* check for the right sequence
* debounce the buttons, potentially? is it needed? YES
* make a new text system so im not translating ascii to character map in the game
* decide on the flag
* update the font data - now with a comma!
* have a way to show the answer was wrong.
* show the winning screen
* encode the final flag - so you can't  find the pw with strings
* scatter the key around the ROM
* collect the keys while executing the program
* when the good password is entered, decrypt the pw
* load memory map of that password
* yayyy should still see password -> but no strings of pw in ROM

Won't Do
* randomize how the tiles are loaded in vram

Players have to find the solution sequence to open the door.
I don't want players to just jump to the final pass function or find the
solution in ROM, so I'm encrypting the flag and scattering the key
around the ROM so force the player to execute all of the ROM. LOL Jor called that white box crypto.
