# CTF Ideas

To Do
* made code harder to reverse
    * add dummy success functions -> eg. if you are only partially successful, you get a wrong password.
    * spread the check around in multiple places.
    * dummy function -> feed him bad code?
    * write own custom read joypad function
* make a blog post on my website to host this puzzle
* write out the hints
* write out the recommended tools.
* submit the puzzle

Once i get the art
* write out the dialog for both scenes
* draw walking animation

Nice to have
* Change all UBYTE and UWORD to UINT8 etc
* change all consts to be defined with 0xFFU
* Level 2 logic!
* make the encryption optimized for the GBA
* UNIT TESTS
* if enter konami code, it will say "long live kojima"
* remove nintendo from the beginning of the game... .-.
* make gbdk more efficient

Done
* figure out the password
* have a way to store button presses
* read in the buttons
* check for the right sequence
* debounce the buttons, potentially? is it needed? YES
* decide on the flag
* update the font data - now with a comma!
* have a way to show the answer was wrong.
* show the winning screen
* encode the final flag - so you can't  find the pw with strings
* scatter the key around the ROM
* collect the keys while executing the program
* when the good password is entered, decrypt the pw
* load memory map of that password
* yayyy should still see password -> but no strings of pw in ROM
* find a way to display which key is pressed
* fix the button display indexing
* the last button input arrow is being displayed in the wrong place??
* debounce keys better
* need to be able to input more than once button at once
* FIXME: in the intro text after the ellipses, the arrow cursor is too far.
* show sequence of what you've already pressed on screen
* edit ellipses character to be at the bottom of the tile, not middle.
* load in the background
* fix (unsigned blah) to const UINT8.
* make sure button presses are ok...
* blinking in animation for agent
* fix window to load border from the black space I have already -> why are bg and window loaded from separate space from sprites?
* fix the win screen

Won't Do
* randomize how the tiles are loaded in vram
* make a new text system so im not translating ascii to character map in the game
* figure out best way to load dialog into game (probably hard coded character maps)
* port from GBDK to a custom GB library...

Players have to find the solution sequence to open the door.
I don't want players to just jump to the final pass function or find the
solution in ROM, so I'm encrypting the flag and scattering the key
around the ROM so force the player to execute all of the ROM. LOL Jor called that white box crypto.

Password:
    S N N S E N S W N W W N S N E N
    16 directional characters

    S W A N B A N S S A N E W E B S
    D L A U B A U D     D A U R L R B D
    16 button presses

Flag:
    girl power? some feminist message?
    something about hacking?
    TR1AL_4ND_3RR0R
    V3RY_G00D_GU3SS

## Story

She is a hired pen tester. Hacking her way through this VR world.
She is tracking down a rogue AI who is corrupting the VR world.
Level 1. street, match the password
Level 2. computer, fake the network packets to the GB
Level 3. edit the rom in some way lmao

How to use the GBMD

The tile offset is in decimal. It wants the offset of where in the bank your tiles start. Need to set 8 bits per plane.

Director: Agent, our alt
reality world is at risk.
your mission is to track down the rogue AI.

Are you ready?

Agent: You got it boss.
I'm going in.

L O A D I N G
A G E N T ...

<flash animation>

This must be the AI's hide out.
The door needs a code...


After success:
show full screen of text to tell some story!




Failure:
    I can not die here.
    I still have so many
    regrets in life.
    If only I had more power... (AHEM CLUE)

Success:

    <discuss morality of something>

    Why are you after me?
    I did nothing wrong!

    Your existence is wrong.

    pew pew (zap?)

    The rogue AI has been terminated.
    My mission is complete.

    (she walks away as sun is rising on the city)

    She blinks out of existence when she reaches the exit portal.
